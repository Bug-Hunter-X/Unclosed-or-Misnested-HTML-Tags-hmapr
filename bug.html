It often occurs when working with nested elements like <code>div</code>s, <code>span</code>s, or tables.  Browsers try to correct these errors, but the behavior can be unpredictable and lead to unexpected layout and styling issues.</p><p><b>Example:</b></p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;
